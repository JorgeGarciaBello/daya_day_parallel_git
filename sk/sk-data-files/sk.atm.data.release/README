 The files in this tarbal contain maps of the Super-Kamiokande likelihood distribution
from the analysis presented in arXiv:1710.09126 and ROOT files containing atmospheric mixing contours from the 
analysis.


::::::: Chi^2 Maps

 Four maps are included, two from each of the main analyses:

 sk.complete.201803.ih.x  - Inverted hierarchy analysis with theta_13 as a fitted parameter
 sk.complete.201803.nh.x  - Normal hierarchy analysis with theta_13 as a fitted parameter

 sk.q13-fixed.201803.ih.x - Inverted hierarchy analysis with theta_13 fixed to its PDG2016 value
 sk.q13-fixed.201803.nh.x - Normal hierarchy analysis with theta_13 fixed to its PDG2016 value 

 Each file has a three line header before the start of the actual map.
 The chi^2 column is the Delta chi^2 value taken relative to the best global best fit 
 of each analysis. That is, the minimum chi^2 value from the NH fits has been subtracted.

 Take care that the definition of the atmospheric mass splitting in the files differs 
 for the hierarchies. For NH it is Delta m^2_{32} and for IH it is |Delta m^2_{31}|

::::::: Atmospheric Mixing Contours 

 The 90% C.L. contours for the atmospheric mixing parameters are stored as ROOT TGraphs in these files
 sk1234.atmospheric.201803.ih.root 
 sk1234.atmospheric.201803.nh.root

 Note that both are drawn with respect to the global best fit (the NH hypothesis) from the analysis.
 Two example scripts for drawing the contours are included:

 draw_SK_IH.C 
 draw_SK_NH.C 

 Assuming the root files are in the same directory they can be run as: 
 > root -b -q draw_SK_NH.C
